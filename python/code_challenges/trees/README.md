# Trees


## Challenge

* Node

    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

* Binary Tree

    Create a Binary Tree class
        Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
            pre order
            in order
            post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

* Binary Search Tree

## Approach & Efficiency

* Binary Tree

Time: O(N)
Space:O(1)

* Binary Search Tree

Time: O(log(N))
Space:O(1)

## API



* Add

    Arguments: value
    Return: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.



* Contains

    Argument: value
    Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
